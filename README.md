The program is free-to-use for all kinds of developers.

## What does the project do
This is my own version of vector with partial template specialization for __bool__ type. Here in the code you can see move semantics,
iterators, template magic, etc. 

***
## Why is the project useful
The main goal was to study the basics of modern C++ (from C++11), and upgrading our implementation of vector
was an excellent choice. Another purpose was to implement this data structure in a way that it should not
be slower than the original vector from [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library). Results
can be seen in Worms_game repository.

__A strong request__:
- Do not break the codestyle
- Do not destroy previous functionality with additions
